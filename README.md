# Mina Backend Developer Challenge

If you've been asked to take this challenge, then we think you could have what it takes to join the backend development team at Mina.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your coding and problem-solving skills. It's also an opportunity for us to demonstrate how we like to write our code, and for you to see what kind of work you might be doing.

## What to do

The solution contains two projects - a simple class library, and a corresponding test project.

The class library contains the skeleton for a service which is responsible for ingesting raw charge session data. The service is responsible for:

-   normalising charge sessions
-   rejecting invalid charge sessions
-   rejecting duplicate charge sessions
-   rejecting overlapping charge sessions

Your task is to implement this service.

To aid you, there are a number of failing unit tests in the test project. These should all pass if you implement the service correctly. However, the existing tests do not cover all scenarios; you are encouraged to write additional tests.

## How to submit your code

-   Create a private fork of this repository
-   Push your working solution to your fork
-   Create a pull request from your fork to this repository, and add your hiring manager as a reviewer (bonus points for a demo video in the PR)
-   Email your hiring manager with confirmation that your PR is ready for review

## Rubric

Nobody does perfectly on challenges like this, and that's fine. We're not looking for perfection, we're looking to assess your approach to solving problems.
