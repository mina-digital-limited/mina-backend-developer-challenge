# Mina Backend Developer Challenge

If you've been asked to take this challenge, then we think you could have what it takes to join the backend development team at Mina.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your coding and problem-solving skills. It's also an opportunity for us to demonstrate how we like to write our code, and for you to see what kind of work you might be doing.

## Background information

Mina receives charge session data from a large number of sources and we normalise it before it is ingested. Each source provides data in a different shape and we need to ensure that essential information can be extracted:

-   EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) unique identifier
-   Start timestamp of the charge session
-   End timestamp of the charge session
-   Total consumption, either in Wh or kWh
-   Charge session unique identifier (optional)

If any of the mandatory data is missing, invalid, or violates other rules (e.g. duplicate/overalapping), the entire batch is rejected.

### Timestamp conversion

We can receive the timestamps for Tesla data in a variety of formats. The solution should handle each of the following formats, capturing the appropriate offsets.

| Example                     | Description                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `8/7/2021,00:30`            | Short date in en-US culture format                |
| `2021-08-07 00:30:00`       | ISO format in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)    |
| `2021-08-07 00:30:00 (GMT)` | ISO format in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)           |
| `2021-08-07 00:30:00 (BST)` | ISO format in British Summer Time (BST)           |
| `2021-08-07 00:30:00 (CET)` | ISO format in Central European Time (CET)         |
| `2021-08-07 00:30:00 (DST)` | ISO format in Central European Summer Time (CEST) |

Any other timestamp formats should be rejected.

## What to do

The solution contains two projects - a simple class library, and a corresponding test project.

The class library contains the skeleton for a service, `TeslaChargeSessionIngestionService`, which is responsible for ingesting raw charge session data. The service is responsible for:

-   normalising charge sessions
-   rejecting invalid charge sessions
-   rejecting duplicate charge sessions
-   rejecting overlapping charge sessions

Your task is to implement this service.

To aid you, there are a number of failing unit tests in the test project. These should all pass if you implement the service correctly. However, the existing tests do not cover all scenarios; you are encouraged to write additional tests.
